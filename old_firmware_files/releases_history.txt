What is new in 4.14 firmware:

In scintillation mode added Waterfall Histogram (link1,link2) for energy distribution and CPS intensity estimation. The scale has the same zoom settings as the main MCA window: 512-4096 channels.  Waterfall zoom can be set in the LCD ZOOM X menu.

In scintillation mode added basic identification for Am-241, Cs-137, Ra-226, U-235. Please note, scintillation mode identification does not replace the main MCA RIID mode and has less performance of the identification results compared with the MCA mode. However, it can be a nice add-on along with the new Waterfall Histogram.

Fixed bug in CSV file date. Now the day and month of the recorded CSV spectrum are displayed correctly.

Improved activity calculator. Now it has a better precision function to get efficiency for the selected geometry. You may need to re-calibrate the correction factor in the activity menu.

DOWNLOAD FIRMWARE 4.13 HEX file 07/06/2022 for Teensy 3.5


What is new in 4.13 firmware:

In scintillation mode, the CPS scale is limited to 50000 CPS (50K)

In spectrum mode, added CPS limit threshold alert. If the source activity is too high then spectrum quality is reduced and you will get the alert notice on screen. In that case the spectrum is not reliable. The limit threshold is depending on PMT pulse duration. If you selected the fast MCA mode (default) then the limit is close to 20000 CPS for spectrum, but if you are using pulse with long decay time the threshold is about 1100 CPS. The CPS limit and MCA mode can be toggled through serial monitor service command like: s101 or s102. For default fast MCA send s101, for slow scintillator send s102. Please download the latest PDF manual for more details.

Added support for BLE module BT4502, please see user manual for more details how to connect smartphone to BT4502  

Added serial service command to set BLE module model. s10 for BM71BLE / RN4871; s11 for BT4502

Added support for Teensy 3.6 processor board. Now we publish 2 files for download. Please use the correct HEX for your device update. If you are not sure what type of the processor you have, then probably you have Teensy 3.5. Send service command s12 to get processor name via serial terminal. If you have any doubts please contact us by email. 

Improved algorithm for averaging Geiger Muller CPS.

In scintillation mode, when scintillation probe is physically disconnected and read cps=0, the doserate can be calculated with GM tube CPM.

Added serial monitor service command to toggle Geiger-Muller tube type. Send s13 to toggle tube name. Supported types are: SBM-21(default), SBM-20, LND-7312, Si29-BG

What is new in 4.12 firmware:

Library is structured into two groups. Now you can set in the RIID f(x) menu what type of the library to use: Industrial/N.O.R.M or Medical. Selected library hint is also shown on the main display as MED or IND. IND/N.O.R.M. includes:Cs-137, Am-241, Co-60, Co-57, Ba-133, Eu-152, Ra-226, Th-232, U-235, K-40  MED includes: I-131, Lu-177, F-18(beta) and following isotopes as it also used in Nuclear Medicine for calibration or procedures: Cs-137, Co-60, Co-57

I-131 assigned to the correct Medical classification.

DOWNLOAD FIRMWARE 4.11 HEX file 05/04/2022

What is new in 4.11 firmware:

New isotopes added to the library: I-131, Co-57

Improved identification of Co-60

Fixed minor RIID bugs for low activity Ra-226 / Cs-137 

RIID f(x) menu now includes also I-131, Co-57, Co-60 tolerance settings. If one of the isotopes from the library list pop-up with false positive too often, then you can decrease the tolerance %. Set all 0% as the default levels. Correct setting for your probe geometry can be found experimentally, normally tolerance can be set in range +/- 20% for a typical detector.

Added support for the new website browser application:  https://spectrum.nuclearphoenix.xyz/ You can use USB serial connection to view live data uploaded from Nuclear Pioneer to the browser. NuclearPhoenix is very nice online MCA that allows to open CSV spectrum files and support live data logging from a different hardware MCA. You can contact the author of this application through the forum: https://www.geigerzaehlerforum.de/index.php/topic,969.0.html 


By default, serial logging is OFF for live data. Nuclear Pioneer uses ";" delimiter for serial logging to make it compatible with the website logging. To toggle live data upload please send serial service command s1818 to the Nuclear Pioneer prior connecting with browser application. You can use Arduino IDE serial terminal or NuclearPhoenix Console to send service command.

What is new in 4.10 firmware:

Added spectrum line draw mode (LIN or LOG). You can toggle bar / line mode in the new LCD DRAW MODE menu.

Added date&time label in spectrum viewer when file is opened.

Fixed minor bug in printing temperature text during energy scale calibration.

In RIID f(x) menu fixed bug of printing and scrolling percentage values, now you can set +/-75%

In RIID f(x) menu introduced a new function that allows to hide Compton continuum. This function can be useful to identify a shielded N.O.R.M. source in situ analyzing.  

Added BLE command to  control Compton-hide properties  (abstract units, refer user manual).

Added serial monitor command to  control Compton-hide properties  (abstract units, refer user manual).

Fixed bug in monitoring of low battery level.

Improved Cs-137 and Ra-226 identification confidence for 63x63mm and 51x51mm crystals.  The software will perform deeper analyze  for faster identification of low activity / shielded source, however the deep analysis currently programmed only for large volume crystal and may not work correctly if you connect small detector. That's why for better performance of RIID using large crystal is recommended.
