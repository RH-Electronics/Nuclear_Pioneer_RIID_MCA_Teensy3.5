Nuclear Pioneer RIID MCA Multichannel Analyzer Electronic Module.

The initial project was based on Teensy 3.5 board with MK64FX512 processor. Unfortunately, these Teensy 3.5 boards are no longer available. Paul from PJRC.com do not believe supply of chips for Teensy 3.x is likely to ever fully recover. These chips are made with 90 nm silicon process. Most of the world's semiconductor fabs are focusing on 45 nm or smaller, leaving limited supply for older chips.

That's why the Nuclear Pioneer project moved to a new edition with Teensy 4.1 - Nuclear Pioneer PRO

This repository will keep the firmware files and user manual for the version with Teensy 3.5
